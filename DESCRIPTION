Title: Shortest Paths Between Points in Grids
Version: 1.1.0
Authors@R: person("Christian", "DÃ¼ben", email = "christian.dueben@uni-hamburg.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package computes shortest paths between points in grids. It can take barriers and custom transition functions into account. Apart from 
  applications regarding planet Earth, spaths can compute shortest paths generally on spheres and planes. The package is optimized for computational 
  performance, customizability, and user friendliness. It comes with its own graph-theoretical implementation tailored to gridded data.
